scm-5f3 news:

scm-5f3 is a bugfix release.  Details at
<http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/scm/scm/ChangeLog>

	* scl.c (pmantexp2dbl): Scale mantissa length for unnormalized FP.
	* scl.c (pmantexp2dbl): Do multiplication or division in FP when
	it fits (uses precomputed dpows5[23]).
	* scl.c (pdbl2str): Moved power-of-two test earlier to avoid
	bignum recycling.
	* scl.c: For powers-of-2 try incrementing quotient before adding
	decimal digit.
	* Makefile: rm -f for info files.
	* keysymdef.scm, x11.scm: X11 codes changed.
	* scl.c: Restricted second conversion to fractional powers of two
	of mant.
	* scl.c (pdbl2str): Corrected for powers of two.
	* r4rstest.scm (test-inexact-printing): Added float-powers-of-2-test.
	* Transcen.scm (real-log): Permit second argument to be 0.
	* Transcen.scm (real-log): Was missing.
	* sys.c (HUGE_LENGTH): Return unsigned long.
	* scm.h: (must_realloc, must_realloc_cell): Made olen and len
	arguments unsigned long.
	* repl.c, scm.h, sys.c(mallocated, lmallocated): Made unsigned long.
	* sys.c (igc_for_alloc): Made olen and size unsigned long.
 from Steve VanDevender
	* scl.c (pmantexp2dbl): Fixed declaration following
	non-declaration statement.
	* scmhob.h (PRE_TRANSC_FUN): big2dbl() --> int2dbl().
	* scl.c (pmantexp2dbl, int2dbl):
	Fixed: (exact->inexact (+ most-positive-fixnum 1)) => 0.
 from Radey Shouman <shouman@comcast.net>
	* subr.c (scm_ash): Make (ash -1 shift) return -1 for
	large values of shift.
 from Karl Zhang
	* build.scm (inexact): feature requires bignum for float I/O.
 from Imre Patyi
	* scl.c: Changed 0.0 to 0. on output.
 from Jakub Bogusz
	* scl.c (scm_ash, scm_round_quotient, product): I noticed that scm
	5f2 built with "make all" fails make check with "Wrong type in
	arg1" (0.0) in round_quotient.
	It appeared to be caused by bigrecy() calls introduced in scm 5f2: in
	some cases some bignum values are used after their bigrecy(), because
	some routines reuse arguments as results:
 from Martin Michlmayr
	* scmfig.h: Added support for ARM64 (aarch64).
